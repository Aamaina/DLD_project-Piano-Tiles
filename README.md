# DLD_Project Piano-Tiles
In our DLD project "Piano-Tiles", we've crafted a captivating gaming experience using two Finite State Machines (FSMs). One FSM orchestrates random number generation to determine the lane for the next tile, while the other oversees the game's core states: menuscreen, gameplay, and endscreen. While our initial attempt to integrate a game over picture faced challenges, prompting the temporary deactivation of game over modules, we're actively addressing this to display the end screen correctly. Presently, scoring is showcased via a seven-segment display, but our goal is to enrich this by displaying scores on-screen. Moreover, we're delving into adding music to elevate the gaming ambiance. This involves crafting codes for each musical key, synchronizing them into one module, and playing them through speakers, enhancing the immersive quality of our FPGA-driven gaming experience. Our project not only demonstrates the real-time processing prowess of FPGAs but also offers an interactive gaming journey heightened by captivating audio elements.
